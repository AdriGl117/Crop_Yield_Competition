# Crop_Yield_Competition
*Intro*
This repository contains our code for the Digital Green Crop Yield Estimation Challenge. This was a challenge provided by Zindi to help smallholder farmers predict their estimated yield and understand which factors have an effect on this prediction. 

*Code*
The individual steps of the modelling pipeline, i.e. preprocessing, imputation, feature selection and modelling, are all in a separate script. However, these can be called up via the modelling script 'run_learner.R' so that only this script is required to run the models

*Results*
The results are saved in an .RDS and .csv format in the data folder. The results.csv filte can be opened [here](data/results.csv).
